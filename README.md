If you'd like to learn how to build this application, refer to [this article](https://zolomohan.hashnode.dev/text-to-speech-using-the-web-speech-api-in-javascript).



Text-to-speech convert is a technology that enables computers to read out loud the text displayed on a screen or document file. It’s a useful tool for those with reading difficulties or visual impairments, but it also has practical applications for anyone who wants to listen to written content while multitasking, driving, or simply resting their eyes.

In this blog, we’ll explore how text-to-speech convert works and how to use it.

1. Understanding Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology



Text-to-speech (TTS) technology is a process that involves converting written text into audio speech. The technology uses computer algorithms to analyze the text’s structure and syntax, then creates and plays back an audio recording of the text. This recording can be saved as a file or output through a speaker.

2. How does Text-to-Speech Convert work?

Text-to-speech convert software uses advanced algorithms to create a digital representation of human speech. This is done by analyzing the text structure, syntax, and punctuation, and selecting the appropriate pronunciation, stress, and tone of voice for each word.

The software generates the audio output by processing the text data through a voice engine. This engine is essentially a database of pre-recorded speech that is carefully curated and organized to ensure that the final voice output is natural-sounding and easy to understand.

3. Benefits of TTS

Text-to-speech technology has several benefits that make it a useful and convenient tool. Here are some of the advantages:

- Enables people with visual impairments or reading difficulties to access written content
- Allows for multitasking while listening to content
- Improves comprehension and retention of information
- Provides an alternative to traditional audiobooks
- Can be customized to fit individual preferences, such as voice type, speed, and pitch


4. Using Text-to-Speech Convert

There are several text-to-speech convert software available today. Some software comes as pre-installed features on e-readers or smartphones, while others can be installed as extensions or plugins on browsers or software programs.

To use text-to-speech convert:

- Select and copy the text you want to listen to.
- Open a text-to-speech software/app
- Paste the text into the text-to-speech app
- Choose the voice type, speed, and pitch according to preference
- Click the “play” button and listen to the audio output

In conclusion, text-to-speech technology is an innovative tool that makes it possible for people to listen to written content while engaging in other activities. It has several benefits, such as improving comprehension, providing an alternative to traditional audiobooks, and giving access to written content for people with reading difficulties or visual impairments. With its increasing popularity, we can expect to see even more developments in this technology in the future.
